# Unity Procedural Animation

[Procedural IK Animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_animation) implemeted in Unity.

[Normal animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation) uses a key frame animation clip, which contains the transforms of the joints in chronological order and these recorded animation clips are just 'played' on the bone model.  
But unlike a normal one, this method uses [IK (Inverse Kinematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics) to procedurally position joints, so it automatically generates animation in real-time to allow for a more diverse series of actions and an interaction with terrain features.
